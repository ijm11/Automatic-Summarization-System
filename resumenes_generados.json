It’s important to note what’s excluded, like PhD programs.  \n\nNext, the scholarship amounts: there’s a basic grant, fixed income and residency components, and variable amounts based on grades and income. The income thresholds and academic requirements (credit thresholds and minimum grades) are critical for eligibility.  \n\nSpecial provisions like disability adjustments and insular supplements should be highlighted, as they affect specific groups. The application deadlines are tight, so I’ll emphasize the dates clearly.  \n\nI’ll structure it to flow naturally: start with eligibility, then financial details, requirements, deadlines, and special provisions. Keeping it under 300 words means avoiding minor details like exact patrimony limits unless crucial. The tone should be informative but approachable for a student."

They were **significantly increased starting in 2024-25**, with a further slight rise for 2025-26. For example, for a 4-member family, Umbral 1 rose from €21,054 to €22,107.\n*   **Asset Limits:** All patrimony limits (urban/rural properties, capital) remained unchanged throughout the period.\n*   **Academic Requirements:** Core requirements were stable: a minimum access grade of 5.0, passing a required percentage of credits (varying by field from 65% to 90%), and enrolling in a minimum of 60 credits (full-time) or 30 credits (part-time).\n*   **Deductions & Disability:** Family, disability, and orphan deductions remained largely constant.

Coverage & Eligibility:**\nThe scholarships support a wide range of **post-compulsory and higher education**. Eligible programs include: Baccalaureate, intermediate and advanced Vocational Training (including military centers), professional and advanced Arts and Sports studies, advanced Religious studies, official Language school courses, access courses, and Basic Vocational Training. For university studies, they cover official Bachelor's and Master's degrees (including those at defense and police academies), access courses for over-25s, and specific complementary credits. Scholarships are not awarded for PhDs, specializations, or university-specific degrees.\n\n**2. Main Components & Amounts:**\nThe scholarship is comprised of several fixed and variable components:\n*   **Fixed Amounts:** A **basic grant** (€300) and a **fixed income-based grant** (€1,700) remained constant for all five years.\n*   **Residence Grant:** This saw a significant increase: €1,600 (2021-2023), rising to **€2,500 (2023-2025)**, and then to **€2,700 (2025-2026)**.\n*   **Variable Amount:** A minimum of €60, calculated based on family income and assets.\n*   **Excellence Supplement:** For university students with high GPAs, ranging from €50 (GPA 8.0-8.49) to €125 (GPA 9.5+).\n*   **Additional Supplements:** Fixed amounts for students from islands (€442-€937) and, from 2023-24, a €300 supplement for Vocational Training students in the Canary Islands.\n*   **Income Deductions:** Standard deductions are applied for large families (€525-€800), disabilities (€1,811-€4,000), orphans (20%), single-parent families (€500), and siblings studying away from home (€1,176).\n\n**3. Evolution of Income Thresholds & Requirements:**\n*   **Income Thresholds:** The family income thresholds for eligibility (Umbrales 1, 2, and 3) were **identical from 2021-2022 through 2023-2024**. They were **increased for the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026** academic years. For example, for a 4-member family, Umbral 1 rose from €21,054 to €22,107.\n*   **Academic Requirements:** Core requirements remained stable: a minimum access grade of 5.0, passing a required percentage of credits (varying by field from 65% to 90%), and enrolling in a minimum of 60 credits (30 for part-time). Rules for students with disabilities (≥65%) also remained consistent.\n*   **Asset Thresholds:** Limits for urban/rural properties (€42,900) and financial capital (€1,700) showed no change over the five years.\n\n**4. Application Deadlines & Notable Changes:**\nA major procedural change occurred after the first year:\n*   **2021-2022:** Deadlines were exceptionally late (Sept 30/Oct 14, 2021).\n*   **2022-2023 onward:** The schedule normalized to a **spring application window** (from mid/late March to mid-May) for the following academic year. The final deadline for submitting required documents is typically December 31st of the academic year.\n\nIn summary, the scholarship framework has been stable, with notable increases in the residence allowance and, more recently, income eligibility thresholds. The application process shifted to a standard spring timeline after an anomalous late cycle for 2021-2022.",

Eligibility is broad and unchanged, covering post-secondary and university studies. The main components are fixed amounts that mostly stayed the same, except for the residence allowance which increased recently. \n\nIncome thresholds only changed in 2024-2025, likely due to inflation adjustments. Academic requirements and application deadlines remained stable, though the deadlines shifted from very late in 2021-2022 to spring periods in subsequent years. The summary should highlight these patterns without getting bogged down in repetitive details."
