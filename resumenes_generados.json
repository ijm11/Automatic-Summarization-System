For university students, grants are available for official bachelor's and master's degree programs, including those at military and police university centers, as well as access courses for students over 25 and certain complementary credits. Studies for doctoral degrees, specializations, and university-specific degrees are not included.\n\nThe financial award consists of several components. A fixed amount of 300 euros is provided as a basic grant. Students may also receive a fixed income-based component of 1,700 euros and a residence supplement of 2,500 euros if they must live away from home to study. A variable amount, starting from a minimum of 60 euros, is calculated based on family income and assets. Additionally, an excellence supplement is awarded based on the previous year's average grade: 50 euros for an average of 8.00 to 8.49, 75 euros for 8.50 to 8.99, 100 euros for 9.00 to 9.49, and 125 euros for an average of 9.50 or higher. Students from the Balearic and Canary Islands are eligible for specific geographical supplements.\n\nTo qualify, applicants must meet strict academic, economic, and asset requirements. Academic requirements vary: university students must pass a minimum of 60 credits for full-time studies or 30 credits for part-time studies in the previous year, with specific pass rate percentages required by field of study (e.g., 90% for Arts, 65% for Sciences).

Fixed amounts like basic grant, residence, and income thresholds. The user mentioned including all financial and requirement details. So I should break down the fixed grants, variable components, and academic excellence awards. Also, the income thresholds and deductions for special circumstances like large families or disabilities.\n\nAcademic requirements: credit thresholds, minimum grades, and percentage of credits needed per field. Make sure to mention the 60/30 credit rule and the 5.00 grade requirement. \n\nSpecial supplements for island students and deductions—these might affect eligibility, so include them. Deadlines are important too; note the March to May period and the extended date for some cases.\n\nThe user emphasized plain text only, no markdown.

Eligible studies include post-compulsory and higher non-university education such as Bachillerato, vocational training, artistic and sports studies, as well as university bachelor's and master's degrees. PhD and specialization programs are excluded.\n\nFinancial support consists of several components. A fixed income grant of 1,700 euros, a residence grant of 1,600 euros, and a basic grant of 300 euros are available. Additionally, a variable minimum amount of 60 euros can be awarded. Excellence grants are offered based on academic performance: 50 euros for an average grade of 8.00 to 8.49, 75 euros for 8.50 to 8.99, 100 euros for 9.00 to 9.49, and 125 euros for 9.50 or higher.\n\nEligibility is determined by income and asset thresholds. Income limits vary based on family size, with three tiers: Umbral 1, 2, and 3, specifying maximum annual incomes. Asset limits include 42,900 euros for urban properties, 42,900 euros for rural constructions, 13,130 euros per member for rural properties, and 1,700 euros for movable capital.\n\nAcademic requirements include enrolling in a minimum of 60 credits for full-time studies or 30 credits for part-time.

Credit completion rates vary by field, such as 90% for Arts and Humanities or 65% for Sciences.\n\nSpecial provisions include island supplements for students in specific regions, ranging from 442 to 937 euros. Income deductions are available for large families, disabilities, orphans, and single-parent families. For students with disabilities of 65% or more, there is a reduction in course load and a 50% increase in grant for full enrollment.\n\nThe application period for both university and non-university students is from March 30, 2022, to May 12, 2022. Applicants should ensure they meet all criteria and submit within this timeframe.\n\nNow, check the word count. Let me estimate: this draft is around 250 words. I need to ensure it covers all relevant details without being too lengthy.\n\nRefine for clarity and conciseness:\n\n- Mention the exact amounts and thresholds.\n\n- Specify that the grants are for Spanish territory.\n\n- Emphasize that this is based on official BOE data.\n\nFinal summary in plain text:"

            "text": "The Spanish Ministry of Education has published the official call for grants and scholarships for the 2024-2025 academic year. This call covers a wide range of post-compulsory and higher education programs. Eligible studies include high school (Bachillerato), vocational training cycles (medium and higher grade), professional and higher arts education, sports education, higher religious studies, official language school courses, access courses for vocational training, and Basic Vocational Training cycles. For university studies, the grants cover official Bachelor's and Master's degree programs, including those at military and police university centers, as well as specific access and complementary courses. Studies for doctoral programs, specializations, and university-specific degrees are not included.\n\nThe financial aid consists of several components. All eligible students receive a basic grant of 300 euros. A fixed amount based on family income is provided, which is 1,700 euros. For students who must live away from their family home to study, a residence supplement of 2,500 euros is available. There is also a variable grant, with a minimum amount of 60 euros, which is calculated based on the student's academic performance and the family's financial situation. Additionally, an excellence supplement is awarded for high academic achievement in the previous year, ranging from 50 euros for an average grade between 8.00 and 8.49, up to 125 euros for an average of 9.50 or higher. Extra supplements are available for students studying in the Balearic or Canary Islands to cover additional costs.\n\nEligibility is primarily determined by family income and assets, with specific thresholds that depend on the number of family members. For example, for a family of four, the general income threshold is 22,107 euros. There are also limits on the value of urban properties, rural land, and financial capital. Several deductions can be applied to the family's calculated income, such as for large families, students with disabilities, orphans, or single-parent families.\n\nKey academic requirements must be met. For university students, a minimum of 60 credits must be enrolled for full-time status, or 30 for part-time. The required pass rate for enrolled credits varies by field of study, from 65% in Sciences and Engineering to 90% in Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences. For first-year university students, a minimum university access grade of 5.00 is required. Students with a disability equal to or greater than 65% have reduced course load requirements.\n\nThe application period is open from March 19, 2024, until May 10, 2024. It is crucial to submit the application within this timeframe through the official channels.",

            "text": "Analysis of Spanish Scholarship Data from 2021-2022 to 2025-2026\n\nThis report analyzes the provided scholarship data to identify trends in thresholds, amounts, and requirements over the specified academic years.\n\nOverall Stability and Core Consistency\nThe scholarship framework shows remarkable stability in its core structure. The types of eligible educational programs, basic academic requirements, fixed grant components (basic grant, fixed income component), and excellence award brackets remained completely unchanged from 2021-2022 through 2025-2026.\n\nSignificant Trends and Changes\n\n1. Major Increase in Residence Grant Amount\nThe most significant financial change is the substantial increase in the \"cuantia_residencia\" (residence grant).\n- 2021-2022 and 2022-2023: 1,600.00 euros.\n- 2023-2024 and 2024-2025: Increased to 2,500.00 euros.\n- 2025-2026: Increased again to 2,700.00 euros.\nThis represents a total increase of 1,100.00 euros (68.75%) over the period, indicating a strong policy focus on supporting students living away from home.\n\n2. Increase and Reform of Income Thresholds\nA major reform occurred in the 2024-2025 academic year, with income thresholds (\"umbrales_renta\") being increased and presented in a new, clearer tabular format.\n- Years 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024: Used identical threshold values across three categories (Umbral 1, 2, 3).\n- Years 2024-2025 and 2025-2026: All thresholds were raised. For example, for a 1-member household:\n  - Old Umbral 1: 8,422.00 euros.\n  - New Umbral 1 (2024-25 onward): 8,843.00 euros.\nThis increase makes more students eligible for scholarships or higher award levels.\n\n3. Expansion of Insular Supplements\nA new supplement specifically for Vocational Training (FP) students in the Canary Islands (\"suplemento_fp_canarias\") was introduced, valued at 300 euros.\n- This supplement is present in the data for 2023-2024, 2024-2025, and 2025-2026.\n- It is absent from the data for 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.\nThis shows a targeted effort to support students in specific regions and study paths.\n\n4. Enhancement of Disability Support\nThe support structure for students with disabilities was slightly expanded.\n- For 2021-2022 through 2024-2025: Support specified for disability >= 65%.\n- For 2025-2026: An additional increment for disability between 25% and 65% (\"incremento_discapacidad_25_65\": \"25%\") appears in the data. This suggests a broadening of eligibility for additional support.\n\n5. Standardization of Application Periods\nThe application timeline became more standardized and earlier in the year.\n- 2021-2022: Had a late, split deadline (October 14 for university students, September 30 for non-university).\n- From 2022-2023 onward: A unified application period for all students was established, running from mid/late March to mid-May.\nThis creates a clearer, predictable schedule for all applicants.\n\n6. Minor Clarifications in Program Listings\nThe list of eligible programs saw minor textual adjustments, such as \"Ciclos de Formación Profesional\" instead of \"Formación Profesional,\" but the covered educational levels (baccalaureate, vocational training, university studies, etc.) remained consistent throughout all years.\n\nSummary of Key Trends\n- Financial Support Upward Trend: The residence grant saw a major, multi-year increase.\n- Eligibility Expansion: Income thresholds were raised in 2024-2025, and disability support was broadened in 2025-2026.\n- Targeted Supplements: A new, fixed supplement for Canary Islands FP students was introduced.\n- Administrative Simplification: Application periods were unified and standardized, and the presentation of income thresholds was improved.\n\nConclusion\nThe scholarship system from 2021-2022 to 2025-2026 demonstrates a clear evolution towards more generous and accessible support. Policymakers have increased key financial amounts, raised eligibility thresholds, added targeted supplements, and streamlined processes. The core academic and merit-based requirements have been kept stable, ensuring consistency for students. The overall direction points to a strengthened financial aid system with a focus on supporting living costs and broadening inclusion.",

            "text": "Analysis of Scholarship Grants from 2021-2022 to 2025-2026\n\nThis report analyzes the evolution of Spanish government scholarship grants over five academic years. The data shows stability in core academic requirements and some grant amounts, with significant increases in the residency grant and income eligibility thresholds in recent years.\n\nMost Significant Overall Trends:\n- A substantial increase in the residency grant amount.\n- An upward adjustment of income eligibility thresholds, expanding access.\n- Stable academic excellence rewards and core fixed grants.\n- Incremental improvements in support for students with disabilities and from specific regions.\n\nDetailed Year-by-Year Changes:\n\n1. Fixed Grant Amounts:\n- The basic fixed grant for income (cuantia_renta_fija) remained constant at 1,700 euros from 2021-2022 through 2025-2026.\n- The basic scholarship (beca_basica) remained constant at 300 euros.\n- The minimum variable amount (cuantia_variable_minima) remained constant at 60 euros.\n\n2. Residency Grant (Cuantia Residencia):\nThis is a key area of change, showing a significant increase to support living costs.\n- 2021-2022: 1,600 euros\n- 2022-2023: 1,600 euros\n- 2023-2024: 2,500 euros (a major increase of 900 euros)\n- 2024-2025: 2,500 euros\n- 2025-2026: 2,700 euros (a further increase of 200 euros)\n\n3. Academic Excellence Grants (Excelencia):\nThe structure and amounts for merit-based grants remained completely stable.\n- The minimum grant was 50 euros and the maximum was 125 euros every year.\n- The grade brackets for awards were identical:\n- 8.00-8.49 average: 50 euros\n- 8.50-8.99 average: 75 euros\n- 9.00-9.49 average: 100 euros\n- 9.50+ average: 125 euros\n\n4. Income Eligibility Thresholds (Umbrales Renta):\nThresholds were stable for the first three years but increased significantly for the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 cycles. The data structure also changed from a \"Umbral 1/2/3\" object to a simpler table.\n- The thresholds for 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 were identical.\n- For 2024-2025 and 2025-2026, new, higher thresholds were applied. For example, for a 1-member household:\n- Old Umbral 1: 8,422 euros (through 2023-2024)\n- New Umbral 1: 8,843 euros (for 2024-2025 onward)\n- Old Umbral 3: 14,112 euros\n- New Umbral 3: 14,818 euros\nThis pattern of increase applies across all family sizes, making more students eligible.\n\n5. Patrimony (Asset) Limits:\nAll limits remained unchanged throughout the period.\n- Urban property limit: 42,900 euros\n- Rural property limit: 42,900 euros\n- Rural property per member: 13,130 euros\n- Movable capital limit: 1,700 euros\n\n6. Academic Requirements:\nCore requirements showed no change.\n- Full-time credits required: 60\n- Part-time credits required: 30\n- University access grade required: 5.00\n- The percentage of passed credits required by field of study remained the same:\n- Arts and Humanities: 90%\n- Sciences: 65%\n- Social and Legal Sciences: 90%\n- Health Sciences: 80%\n- Engineering and Architecture: 65%\n\n7. Island Supplements (Suplementos Insulares):\nBasic amounts were stable. A new supplement for Vocational Training in the Canary Islands appeared in 2023-2024 and continued.\n- The basic insular supplement (442 euros), remote islands supplement (623 euros), and inter-island/peninsula supplements (888 and 937 euros) did not change.\n- A new \"suplemento_fp_canarias\" of 300 euros was introduced in 2023-2024 and continued in 2024-2025 and 2025-2026.\n\n8. Income Deductions:\nAll deductions for large families, disability, orphans, and single-parent families remained constant in amount throughout the five years.\n\n9. Disability Support:\nCore support was stable, with one notable expansion in 2025-2026.\n- The reduction in course load requirement for disability >=65% was constant.\n- The 50% increase for full enrollment with a disability was constant.\n- For 2025-2026 only, a new \"incremento_discapacidad_25_65\" of 25% was introduced, indicating expanded support for those with a disability between 25% and 65%.\n\n10. Application Deadlines:\nThe schedule shifted earlier in the calendar year over time.\n- The main application window moved from Autumn (Sept-Oct) in 2021-2022 to Spring (March-May) from 2022-2023 onward.\n- Example for university students:\n- 2021-2022: Deadline was 14 October 2021.\n- 2022-2023: Window was 30 March to 12 May 2022.\n- 2025-2026: Window is 24 March to 14 May 2025.\n\nConclusion:\nThe scholarship system has maintained consistency in rewarding academic merit and supporting students with specific family or disability situations. The most impactful changes are the substantial increase in the residency grant and the raising of income thresholds. These changes directly increase the financial support for living expenses and broaden eligibility to include more students from middle-income families, reflecting a policy shift towards greater inclusiveness and cost-of-living support. Minor positive changes include the new Canary Islands FP supplement and the additional disability increment in the final year.",

The data is structured but spans multiple years, so I need to compare each field across the years systematically.\n\nFirst, I should organize the data by academic year to spot patterns. The key areas are fixed amounts, residency supplements, income thresholds, academic requirements, and disability support. The residency amount shows clear increases in 2023-2024 and again in 2025-2026, which is a significant trend. \n\nThe income thresholds change in 2024-2025, with a new table format and higher values. That’s another major shift. The academic requirements and excellence grants are stable, but disability support expands in 2025-2026. The island supplements and application deadlines have minor adjustments. \n\nI’ll structure the report chronologically, highlighting the most notable changes in each section. The user emphasized plain text, so I’ll avoid markdown and use simple bullet points where needed. The goal is to make the trends clear without extra formatting."
